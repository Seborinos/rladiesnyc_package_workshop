## Writing functions

Important recommendation:
- Always write functions from you are using from other packages as *pkg::fun()*.
- This will help you avoid any conflicts in the future.
- List the package in DESCRIPTION so that it’s installed (later).
- When using the pipe I avoid this rule and add *importFrom(dplyr, "%>%")* to NAMESPACE (later).

## DESCRIPTION: Dependencies

Imports: 
- Packages listed here must be present for your package to work. They will be installed if not already.
- It will not however attached them, meaning it does do *library(pkg_needed)*.
- The best practice is to explicitly refer to external functions using the syntax *pkg_needed::function()*.
- You can also add them using *usethis::use_packages()*.

Suggest:
- Put packages here that are almost never used in your package.
- For example, only one function uses it.
- Only shows up in examples.
- Only a data set is needed.
- Unlike *Imports* these will not be installed.

## DESCRIPTION: Versioning

- If you need a specific version of a package:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Imports:
    ggvis (>= 0.2),
    dplyr (>= 0.3.0.1)
```

- In RStudio you can look under the *Packages* tab and under *Version*.

## NAMESPACE: export

This is important if you want to publish your package in CRAN:
- For a function to be usable outside of your package, you must export it.
- You might want to keep some functions private / unexposed to the user.
- Add *#' @export* before defining your function and after your documentation.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#' @export 
foo <- function(x, y, z) {
  ...
}
```

- Run *devtools::document()*.
- Check NAMESPACE file and run tests to check that the specification is correct.

## NAMESPACE: import

This is important regardless of whether you want to publish in CRAN or not:
- NAMESPACE controls which external functions can be used by your package without having to use *::*.
- Very important if you want to use the pipe (add *importFrom(dplyr, "%>%")*).
- It’s common for packages to be listed in Imports in DESCRIPTION, but not in NAMESPACE. 
General recommendations:
- List the package in DESCRIPTION so that it’s installed, then always refer to it explicitly with *pkg::fun()* (best option, most tedious). 
- If you are using only jsut a few functions then always do this.
- If you are using functions repeatedly you can use *importFrom(pkg, fun)*.
- You can import all of the functions of the package with *importFrom(pkg)* (worst option, less tedious).
